Infrastructure Analyst • July, 2017 — February, 2018

Harley-Davidson Motor Company

Researched H-D's Windows and Linux infrastructure to identify components due for decommission. I developed monitoring and discovery tools with ServiceNow, Flexera, SCCM, Stealthwatch and Solarwinds to measure the usage and state of IT assets. Through application analysis I determined ownership and dependencies to minimize decommisson impact. Most importantly, I partnered with business relationship managers to successfully disposition unused infrastructure.

In order to deliver these features I got familiar with AngularJS, Bootstrap and Sass.
